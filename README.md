## To implement an AI chasing algorithm for Unreal Engine, you can follow these general steps:

### Set up the AI character: Create a character blueprint for the AI with its movement and perception components. Set up the necessary collision and physics settings.

### Implement the perception system: Add a perception component to the AI character blueprint. Configure it to detect the player character using senses like sight or hearing.

### Detect the player: In the AI character blueprint, create a custom event that triggers when the player is detected. You can use the perception system to check if the player is visible or within a certain range.

### Move towards the player: When the player is detected, use AI navigation to move the AI character towards the player's location. You can use the AI MoveTo blueprint node to calculate the path and move the AI character along it.

### Continuously update the destination: Periodically update the destination of the AI character based on the player's current location. This ensures that the AI character continues to chase the player even if they move.

### Handle obstacles: Implement obstacle avoidance to prevent the AI character from colliding with objects in the environment. You can use AI navigation and raycasting to detect obstacles and calculate new paths accordingly.


### Test and refine: Test the AI chasing algorithm in your game environment and iterate on it as needed. Fine-tune parameters such as detection range, movement speed, and obstacle avoidance to achieve the desired behavior.
